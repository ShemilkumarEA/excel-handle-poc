Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.</p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;"><br></p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;"></p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;">An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Management, as well as evaluating the overall</p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;">presentation of the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements due to fraud or error may occur and not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the SAs.</p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;"><br></p><p style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; letter-spacing: normal;">In making our risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.
